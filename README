Hi all,

This is going to be a public directory where I dump small scripts that I make for
competitive coding websites (or simply coding websites... e.g. project euler, usaco, topcoder,
stackoverflow, and any other website that requires code. Some of this stuff maybe be useful
(but most likely not). Feel free to take anything you'd like, or fork/add your own solutions
if you have a clever one as well.
