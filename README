I am going to try to find short solutions in commonly used programming languages, 
(ones that I've had at least some exposure to - C/C++/Java/Python/Perl/Ruby). If I do
not immediately see a way to write a really short solution or am otherwise stumped by a
problem, I might temporarily write a long solution and post it here while looking for
ways to shorten it on the project euler forums.

The end goal is to see how many project euler problems are solvable with one-line solutions
(in any language), and how short you can make any individual solutions.

If you have any short/golf-y solutions you wrote yourself, please contribute!
